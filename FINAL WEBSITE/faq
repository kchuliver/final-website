    <h1> WHY WAS I CHOSEN?</h1>

     <p> Gods have varying reasons for choosing their champions- it would be best to ask them yourself! However, we can assure you that there is nothing inherently special about you that makes you God's Favorite Person. Many gods choose randomly! </p>

     <h1>HOW DOES BEING SENT BACK TO LIFE WORK, EXACTLY?</h1>
     <p> By manipulating the strands of time and fortune alike, gods are able to return you to life with minimal impacts from your near-death experience. You will not remember your experiences in the purgatourney*, and may return to the exact life you left previously.

        *note: the purgatoutney is not responsible for any strange dreams, hallucinations, feelings of deja vu, and/or traumatic responses.

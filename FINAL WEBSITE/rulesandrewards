    <h1> THE RULES</h1>

     <p> -All souls begin the game with one godly boon, or superpower given to you by your sponsor. 
        -Souls gain points by competing challenges, finding treasures, or taking them from other players, willingly or through force.
        -Every 100 points grants the souls a new LEVEL and increases the power of their BOON. Souls gain a second BOON at levels five, ten, twenty-five, fifty, and one-hundred.
        -The souls with the lowest number of points every CYCLE will be eliminated

     </p>

     <h1>THE REWARDS</h1>
     
     <p> -All souls will be returned to life, and given one wish to improve their life on earth.
     -Souls may wish for anything so long as it does not break the rules of reality or alter the past of the timeline. 
     -Souls may take as long as they wish to specify the parameters of their wish. This is not a monkey's paw situation, we truly work to ensure you will be happy in your new life!
